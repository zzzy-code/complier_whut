# Compiler Principles Experiments

This repository contains two experiments from the Compiler Principles course at Wuhan University of Technology.

## Experiment 1: Lexical Analysis

The first experiment focuses on lexical analysis. It involves the creation of a lexical analyzer that can tokenize a given source code. The goal is to identify keywords, operators, variables, and other components of the source language.

## Experiment 2: Syntax Analysis

The second experiment is about syntax analysis. It aims to implement a syntax analyzer (parser) that checks the structure of the source code based on a given grammar. The experiment involves constructing a parser that can detect and report syntax errors.
